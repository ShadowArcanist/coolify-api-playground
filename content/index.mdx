## Know Issue
Fumadocs automatically includes all properties in the request with `null` or empty values, even if you've only filled in one field. This can lead to errors.

If the API endpoint doesn't require all fields to be filled, you can manually remove the unnecessary properties. To do this, open the JSON editor, delete any fields you donâ€™t need, and then click the "Send" button.
